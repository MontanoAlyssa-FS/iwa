            A <strong>gemstone</strong> (also called a fine gem, jewel, precious
            stone, semiprecious stone, or simply gem) is a piece of mineral
            crystal which, when cut or polished, is used to make jewelry or
            other adornments.[1][2][3] Certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli,
            opal, and obsidian) and occasionally organic materials that are not
            minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) may also be used for
            jewelry and are therefore often considered to be gemstones as
            well.[4][5] Most gemstones are hard, but some softer minerals such
            as brazilianite may be used in jewelry[6] because of their color or
            luster or other physical properties that have aesthetic value.
            However, generally speaking, soft minerals are not typically used as
            gemstones by virtue of their brittleness and lack of durability.

          <h2>Characteristics and classification</h2>
          <p id="characteristicsandclassification">
            The traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the
            ancient Greeks, begins with a distinction between precious and
            semi-precious; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In
            modern use, the precious stones are emerald, ruby, sapphire and
            diamond, with all other gemstones being semi-precious.[9] This
            distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient
            times, as well as their quality: all are translucent, with fine
            color in their purest forms (except for the colorless diamond), and
            very hard with a hardness score of 8 to 10 on the Mohs scale.[10]
            Other stones are classified by their color, translucency, and
            hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect
            modern values; for example, while garnets are relatively
            inexpensive, a green garnet called tsavorite can be far more
            valuable than a mid-quality emerald.[11] Another traditional term
            for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and archaeology is
            hardstone. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a
            commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it suggests
            certain stones are more valuable than others when this is not
            reflected in the actual market value, although it would generally be
            correct if referring to desirability.

          <h2>Value</h2>
          <p id="value">
            Gemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are
            graded using a system developed by the Gemological Institute of
            America (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were
            graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major
            innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard
            for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the
            naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).
          </p>
          <p>
            A mnemonic device, the "four Cs" (color, cut, clarity, and carats),
            has been introduced to help describe the factors used to grade a
            diamond. With modification, these categories can be useful in
            understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry
            different weights depending upon whether they are applied to colored
            gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, the cut is the
            primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. An
            ideally cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its
            constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright
            little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye
            (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none
            of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called
            "cut". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the
            purity, and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of
            quality.

          <h2>Colors</h2>
          <p id="colors">
            The color of any material is due to the nature of light itself.
            Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the
            spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light
            is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or
            wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye
            as the perceived color.[38] A ruby appears red because it absorbs
            all other colors of white light while reflecting red.

          <h2>Treatment</h2>
          <p id="treatment">
            Gemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the
            stone.[41] In some cases, the treatment applied to the gemstone can
            also increase its durability. Even though natural gemstones can be
            transformed using the traditional method of cutting and polishing,
            other treatment options allow the stone's appearance to be
            enhanced.[42] Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they
            can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely
            because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted
            most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to
            the original tone.[43]

          <h2>Synthetic and artificial gemstones</h2>
          <p id="syntheticandartificialgemstones">
            Synthetic gems are physically, optically, and chemically identical
            to the natural stone, but are created in a laboratory.[57] Imitation
            or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone,
            but may appear quite similar to it; they can be more easily
            manufactured synthetic gemstones of a different mineral (spinel),
            glass, plastic, resins, or other compounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of simulated or imitation stones include cubic zirconia,
            composed of zirconium oxide, synthetic moissanite, and uncolored,
            synthetic corundum or spinels; all of which are diamond simulants.
            The simulants imitate the look and color of the real stone but
            possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. In
            general, all are less hard than diamond. Moissanite actually has a
            higher refractive index than diamond, and when presented beside an
            equivalently sized and cut diamond will show more "fire".
